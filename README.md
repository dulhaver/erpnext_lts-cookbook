# ERPNext LTS cookbook

this repo should serve for the creation of a formal document to describe the processes and procedures that will 
eventually allow to formally label an [ERPNext](github.com/frappe/erpnext) version (such as v10.x.x) as LTS

I assume upon finalization this can me merged either into the frappe/erpnext repo,

I am creating this as a base for a collaborative effort, wich I am happy to moderate but won't claim any
particular leadership in terms of the actual content of the lts-cookbok.

the master branch will get populated once there is a first working version ready. 
Till then `develop` is the default branch.
